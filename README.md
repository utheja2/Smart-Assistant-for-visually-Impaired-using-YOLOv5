# Smart-Assistant-for-visually-Impaired-using-YOLOv5



Object detection plays a very important role in many applications such as image retrieval, surveillance, robot navigation, way-finding, etc. 
The propose system detects objects in the web camera frame and frame and alerts the user about its movement by tracking objects location. 
When an object movement is detected a voice alarm is generated for guiding the blind persons around. 
The object detection is achieved by YOLO object detection model. This uses deep neural networks to learn and detect objects. 
Visual impairment and blindness caused by various diseases has been hugely reduced but there are many people who are at risk of age-related visual impairment.
Visual information is the basis for most navigational tasks, so visually impaired people are at disadvantage because necessary information
about the surrounding environment is not available. With the recent advances in inclusive technology, 
it is possible to extend the support given to people with visual impairment during their mobility.
In this context we propose a system, named Smart Vision, whose objective is to give blind users the ability to move around in unfamiliar environment
whether indoor or outdoor, through a user friendly.
